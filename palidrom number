Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?



class Solution:
    # @param x, an integer
    # @return a boolean
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        if x < 0:
            return False

        ranger = 1
        while x / ranger >= 10:
            ranger *= 10

        while x:
            left = x / ranger
            right = x % 10
            if left != right:
                return False
            
            x = (x % ranger) / 10
            ranger /= 100

        return True
